# Repo content

This repository contains sadsheets, scripts and files I have been using during my learning experience. Excercises were mostly provided by CodeCademy platform that I am a member of. Folders are devided for:

*python
*data vizualisation

But all excercises are mix of both aforementioned. Some excercises are still under development and could be improved. They provide an insight to the topics I familiarize myself with. I work on separate portfolios that will not be included in this repository therefore check out my GitHub and let's stay in touch!
